# item1 = 'Phone'
# item1_price = 100
# item1_quantity = 5
# item1_price_total = item1_price * item1_quantity
#
# print(type(item1))
# print(type(item1_price))
# print(type(item1_quantity))
# print(type(item1_price_total))

# In Python , Each data type is an object that has been instantiated earlier by some class and for the item1 variablethat has been instantiated from
# a string type of class. And for the price_quantity and price_total that have been instantiated from a class named int means integer.

# We can create a data type of our own, it would allow us to write a code that we can re-use in the future easily if needed.
# Now, each instance could have attributes to describe related information about it.
